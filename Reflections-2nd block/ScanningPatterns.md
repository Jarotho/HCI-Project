# ScanningPatterns ðŸ“²

The article presents 4 scanning patterns, which are the ways in which people scan textual information on web pages, which are, F-pattern, blob pattern, layered pattern and engagement pattern.
First, it is important to note that UI scanning patterns are closely related to usability. 
When users can easily find the information they need on a web page or in an application, they are more satisfied and have a more positive experience. 
Therefore, it is important to design the UI in such a way that the browsing patterns are intuitive and relevant to the target audience.

The F-pattern is one of the most common UI scanning patterns identified in research.
This pattern is based on the idea that users scan the content of a page in an F-letter pattern, starting at the top left of the page, then moving to the right and down in successive lines. 
It is particularly relevant for web pages that contain a large amount of textual content.

The blob pattern is another UI scanning pattern identified in the research. 
This pattern is based on the idea that users scan a web page in a non-linear 
fashion and move around the screen in search of engaging visual elements, such as images or videos.

The layered scanning pattern consists of fixations made primarily on the page headings and subheadings. There are few fixations in the text in between, that is, until
users locate the title they are interested in; at that point, they usually read the accompanying body text.

The engagement pattern is another UI exploration pattern identified in the research. This pattern is based on the idea that users interact with the web page actively and engage with the content as they progress through their navigation.

In the prototype we designed for the project of a page for teachers to select activities for children with ADHD, we considered several UI exploration patterns to improve user experience and usability.

One of the browsing patterns we have used is the layered pattern. We have structured the information in different levels of detail and in a clear hierarchical structure to help users find the information they need efficiently. In addition, we have used the engagement pattern to make the navigation more interactive and personalized for users, since, this pattern usually occurs when users are very interested or motivated to read the content.

It is important to consider the Non-Functional Usability Requirements when designing a specific exploration pattern for our prototype. In our case, it is critical that the page be easy for teachers to use. This means that the exploration pattern we choose must be easy to understand and navigate, allowing teachers to quickly find the activities they need for their students.

In summary, it is important to consider the UI browsing patterns relevant to the target audience and the characteristics of your particular project. Designing a user interface that adapts to users' natural browsing patterns can significantly improve usability and user satisfaction.
