# ScanningPatterns :page_with_curl:

Usability is a key factor in user interface design and web page creation. 
It is critical that navigation patterns are intuitive and relevant to the target audience, as this will increase user satisfaction and improve the overall user experience. In addition, it is important to consider non-functional usability requirements in order to design a specific navigation pattern that fits the users' needs.

The F-pattern is one of the most common UI browsing patterns, especially useful on text-heavy web pages. 
This pattern is very effective for web pages that need to be browsed quickly. However, for web pages that require more detailed scanning, the layered pattern can be used.

The layered scanning pattern is useful for web pages that require a higher level of detail and a clear hierarchical structure to help users find the information they need efficiently. 
This scanning pattern is particularly effective for web pages that have a large amount of content, and it is important to structure it properly so that users can find the information they need without having to read all the content.

The point scanning pattern is ideal for web pages that have visually appealing elements, such as images or videos. 
This pattern is useful for users who are looking for specific information, and scroll down the screen looking for attractive elements that may be relevant to them.

The engagement pattern is useful for websites that want to keep users engaged and motivated as they navigate the page. T
his pattern tends to occur when users are highly interested in the content of the page, and actively engage with it.

In the design of the prototype web page for teachers to select activities for children with ADHD, several UI exploration patterns have been considered to improve user experience and usability. 
The layered pattern has been used to structure the information in different levels of detail and in a clear hierarchical structure, 
allowing users to find the information they need efficiently. In addition, the engagement pattern has been used to make navigation more interactive and personalized for users, 
as this pattern tends to occur when users are highly interested or motivated to read the content.
