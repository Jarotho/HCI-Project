# UIDesignPatterns üîç

First we must know and understand what design patterns are. Basically, user interface design patterns are common, "reusable solutions that designers use to address recurring problems in creating user interfaces". A clear example is the "breadcrumb" design pattern that allows users to track their progress and return to previous steps. These patterns can be applied to a variety of situations, although it is important that designers adapt each to the specific context of use.

According to Christopher Alexander, an architect and building theorist, "design patterns are solutions to recurring problems that arise during the design process" (Alexander, C. 1979). Alexander developed the idea of design patterns in the field of architecture, but the idea has since been applied to other areas, such as computer science and user interface design. In user interface design, design patterns are solutions to common problems in interface creation that have proven to be effective in similar situations. These solutions are documented in patterns that designers can reuse to address similar problems in different contexts.

The selected task of the team project is to enable users to search for specific activities for children with ADHD on the website. The relevant user interface pattern for this task is the "search pattern". This pattern is widely used and is essential to enable users to find and access relevant information.

In the user interface, the search pattern is typically implemented as a visible search bar at the top of the web page. Users can enter their search terms and click a search button to initiate the search. Once the search is complete, the search results are displayed in a list or grid, depending on the design.

Also, in the prototype, the search pattern has been implemented with a clearly visible search bar on the home page. Users can enter search terms such as "attention games" or "concentration exercises" and then click on the search button to get relevant results. In addition, autocomplete functionality has been used to help users quickly find the most relevant search terms.

The implementation of the search pattern is relevant to usability goals because it allows users to quickly find the specific activities they are looking for. In addition, the search pattern helps to improve the accessibility and navigation of the website, which in turn improves the user experience and overall user satisfaction.

Similarly, the clear main actions pattern was implemented, i.e., the buttons stand out by color so that users know what to do, if they want to delete something, the button is red; and if they want to confirm or send something, the button is green.

In conclusion, user interface design is a crucial aspect in the development of any project that aims to provide an optimal user experience. Understanding user needs and behaviors is fundamental to creating an effective and user-friendly user interface. User interface design patterns are valuable tools for designers as they enable them to solve common problems efficiently and effectively. By applying design patterns correctly and adapting them to the specific context of use, designers can create attractive and accessible user interfaces that meet the usability requirements of the project. Ultimately, the ultimate goal is to create a satisfying user experience that fosters user loyalty and customer satisfaction.
