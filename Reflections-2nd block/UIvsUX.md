# UI VS UX ðŸ’»

The article clearly and concisely explains the difference between user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design. These terms are often confused, but it's important to understand that while UX focuses on the user experience, UI focuses on the visual and practical side of the web.

UX focuses on how users interact with the website, how they feel when doing so, and how they perceive the quality of the experience. On the other hand, UI focuses on the visual design and layout of the elements on the screen that users interact with.

It is important to understand that both aspects are equally important to the success of a website, as a good UX/UI can increase conversion rate and user retention, and create a strong and recognizable brand.

In our project the UX focuses on how users interact with the application and how they feel when doing so. In this case, the web application provides a user-friendly interface with something the teacher works with on a daily basis, indicating that the user experience has been taken into account and they have sought to make it as enjoyable as possible.

On the other hand, the UI focuses on the visual design and layout of the elements on the screen that users interact with. In this case, the interface elements follow the pattern of the office package, which makes the application intuitive. This indicates that the visual aesthetics and practicality of the interface have been taken into account, which can enhance the user experience.

It is important to note that UX and UI work together to create a complete and satisfying user experience. In this example, attention to both aspects is critical to achieve an effective and user-friendly web application for the teacher.

In conclusion, it is critical to differentiate UX and UI in creating an effective website, as each has a different but complementary approach to the user experience.
