# UI VS UX 

It is very common that people do not know the difference and think that they are the same, however, thanks to the article, you can see that UI and UX are different but related concepts in digital product design. First, UI (User Interface) refers to the appearance and interaction of the user interface elements, while UX (User Experience) focuses on how users interact with the product and how they feel while doing so. Going into more detail, the distinctive definition of UX in web development and design is "The cultivation of customer satisfaction and loyalty through the optimal development of usability and the positive emotional response a visitor experiences with your site" (Aileen. J).

Likewise, UX designers ensure that the composition of your site flows logically from one step to the next. Similarly, they conduct user behavior tests to identify challenges a user may face and keep testing until they eliminate these problems to create the "ideal" UX.
On the other hand, UI (User Interface) refers to the tangible and technical components that enable user interaction with the technology or product, such as buttons, controls and other visual elements. So, the UI has the function of visually displaying the UX elements that have been designed to ensure a meaningful and satisfying user experience.

A clear example in our project regarding UX is how a user interacts with the application. The UX would include how users feel when searching for activities, adding students, and viewing the roster. Also, the application was intended is to make an interface that teachers relate to and feel more comfortable navigating, such as Word. In addition, the site is intended to be a responsive web design so that the proportions are not altered depending on the device.

Continuing, an example of UI in the application is the main screen of the application, where visual elements such as buttons and menus that allow the user to navigate through the different sections of the application are displayed. Typography and colors according to the type of user are sought; likewise, icons are contemplated to facilitate the experience and make it more intuitive.

In conclusion, it is important to keep in mind that UI and UX are interdependent. A good UI can improve the user experience, but a bad UX can spoil even the best UI. Therefore, it is crucial to pay attention to both visual appearance and user interaction and experience when designing digital products.
