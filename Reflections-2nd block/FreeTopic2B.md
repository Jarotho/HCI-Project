# Fundamental Techniques for requirement elicitation üìù

Requirements elicitation is a fundamental step in the design and development process of interactive systems. There are several techniques for eliciting requirements, among which interview, survey and ethnography stand out.

The interview is a technique that involves direct conversation between the designer and the user to obtain information about their needs, requirements and expectations of the interactive system. The interview can be structured, unstructured or semi-structured, and its main advantage is that it allows a personal and direct interaction between the designer and the user, which can facilitate the understanding of the requirements; according to Sommerville (2011) "The interview is a very common requirements elicitation technique and is useful for obtaining detailed and specific information about the system requirements."

Survey is a technique that involves the application of a questionnaire to a group of users to gather information about their needs and preferences. The survey can be online, by e-mail or on paper, and its main advantage is that it allows information to be obtained from a large number of users quickly and efficiently. However, a disadvantage is that the information may be limited or biased if users do not respond truthfully or if the questionnaire is not properly formulated. According to Pressman (2015) "A survey is a method of obtaining information from a large number of people through written or verbal questions."

Ethnography is a technique that involves direct observation of the behavior and activities of users in their natural environment. Ethnography can be useful for obtaining detailed information about the context of use and the needs of users, and can help identify requirements that users are not aware they have. However, a disadvantage is that observation can be intrusive and users may not feel comfortable being observed. According to Carroll and Rosson (2007) "Ethnography is a valuable technique for understanding how users interact with the system in its context of use."

In our case, for the project we used the survey as the elicitation method, since we believe it is the quickest method to obtain information. First we designed the questions that people would have to answer, we considered the type of people who would be responsible for responding; then we used Google forms as a tool to distribute the questions; and finally with the results obtained we made an analysis to have a general conclusion and better understand people.

In conclusion, each requirements elicitation technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the selection of the appropriate technique will depend on the context and objectives of the interactive system project. It is important for designers to carefully consider the characteristics of each technique and to select.
