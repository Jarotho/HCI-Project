It's important to recognize that users play an important role. "The UCD (User-Centered Design) methodology promotes that users are the central axis in the process of design and development of digital products. For this, the needs and expectations of users must be known, and focus the design process on creating solutions that respond to their needs and desires." (Arias & Morillo, 2015, p. 198)

Based on the information obtained about the people who will use the website to work with children with ADHD, the knowledge can be used to improve the prototype of the website. For example, it was identified that teachers prefer a website that is easy to use and has intuitive navigation, a simple and organized user interface can be implemented, with clear menus and well-defined categories. Also, in order to be intuitive and easy to use, we want teachers to feel familiar with the site, so we sought to have a similarity with Microsoft Word, so that they do not need so much time to adapt.

In addition, if it was identified that teachers need an advanced search tool to quickly find specific activities for children with ADHD, an advanced search function can be implemented to allow users to search by category, difficulty level, type of activity, etc.

Another example of how the knowledge gained from the people in the UI was used was in the choice of appropriate language and tone for communication with teachers. During the interviews with teachers, it was observed that they were more comfortable with simple and friendly language, rather than technical and formal language. Therefore, simple terms were used in the user interface and the use of technical jargon was avoided, making it easier for users to understand and navigate. A progress tracking system was also included so that teachers and parents could see how the children were performing in the activities and adapt them if necessary.

In summary, the knowledge gained from the individuals in our research project can help us design a more effective and engaging user interface for our target users, which in turn can improve retention and engagement of ADHD children in teacher-selected activities.
