# The in-depth interview

The Envis Precisel diagram is a useful tool for exploring how different fields have influenced HCI. The in-depth interview is a qualitative research technique used in psychology and other social sciences to gather rich and detailed information about the experiences, thoughts and feelings of participants. The main purpose of this method is to detect subjective feelings and sensations that are not easily observed or measured.

According to author Lawrence Grobel in his book "The Art of the Interview: Lessons from a Master of the Craft," in-depth interviewing involves thorough advance preparation, an authentic connection with the interviewee, listening attentively, being flexible in the structure of the interview, and being willing to be vulnerable and show one's personality. In addition, the interviewer must be willing to follow the thread of the conversation and delve deeper into topics that arise during the interview to obtain detailed and complete information.

HCI has adopted the in-depth interview as a technique for understanding the needs, motivations, and challenges of users. In HCI, in-depth interviews can be used to explore how people use technology in their daily lives, their design preferences, and their expectations for usability. In-depth interviews can also be useful for evaluating prototypes and identifying areas for improvement in existing products.

In-depth interviewing is a valuable technique for HCI because it allows researchers to understand users' needs and perspectives in a more detailed and richer way than other quantitative methods. In addition, the in-depth interview is more flexible than other research methods, allowing researchers to adjust their questions to fit the responses and needs of participants.

However, in-depth interviewing also has limitations. For example, it can be costly and time-consuming to conduct interviews with a significant number of participants. In addition, researcher and participant bias can influence the responses obtained. Therefore, it is important for researchers to take steps to minimize these biases and to analyze the data obtained in a rigorous and systematic manner.
