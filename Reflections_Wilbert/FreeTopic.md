## HCI Fundamentals.

This field of study focuses on how people interact with technology and how this interaction can be improved to meet user needs. The foundation of HCI is user-centered design, which involves the active participation of users in the design process of a system or application.

The goal of HCI is to make technology easier to use and accessible to everyone, regardless of age, gender, disability, or level of technology experience. By making technology easier to use, productivity, efficiency and user satisfaction can be improved. In short, the rationale for HCI is to create technology systems and applications that adapt to the needs, abilities and expectations of users to provide an effective and satisfying user experience.

One of the most prominent authors in the field (HCI) is Ben Shneiderman, who proposed eight golden rules for designing effective user interfaces. These rules have become fundamental principles of HCI and are known as Shneiderman's eight rules.

- Support consistency: similar elements and actions should be handled in the same way throughout the interface.
- Enable informative feedback: users should receive feedback on the outcome of their actions in the interface.
- Provide a way out of unwanted situations: users should be able to exit an unwanted task or situation without having to move on.
- Design for error prevention: interface design should minimize the possibility of errors.
- Allow reversal of actions: users should be able to undo previous actions.
- Provide a clear information hierarchy: information should be organized and presented in a way that reflects its importance and relationship to other information.
- Support user control: users should feel that they are in control of the interface.
- Reduce the users' memory load: the amount of information users have to remember should be reduced as much as possible.
