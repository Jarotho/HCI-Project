The technique used by the team was the survey, we relied on the tool Google forms, we worked distributing the link to teachers who worked with children with ADHD, being online allowed us to save time and resources, in addition to being able to reach a greater number of people.

We opted for this method because, according to Robert K. Yin, a prominent author in the field of social research, there are several advantages to using interviews as a research technique.

- Accessibility: Interviews can be used to study people or groups that are difficult to reach or observe directly, such as people living in remote areas or individuals who are experiencing stressful or sensitive situations.
- Efficiency: surveys can be completed by a large number of people in a short period of time, making them very efficient in terms of data collection.
- Standardization: Surveys can be standardized, i.e., questions and answers can be the same for all participants.
- Control: Surveys allow researchers to have greater control over data collection.

Likewise, with the results obtained, I personally consider that the method was the most appropriate for what the team was looking for, and I also believe that the implementation was the most correct, since, before starting, we already had in mind the users we wanted to reach. We considered a number of questions so that they did not bother to answer, also, we did not pressure them so that they could answer calmly and honestly.

The result obtained from the survey was useful information to continue with the research, where after evaluating the answers, an analysis was made to better understand the ideas, also, to understand how teachers work and possible solutions, at the end of the analysis we sought to reach a general conclusion of the whole team, which was that teachers do not have knowledge of how to treat students and that the help of the USAER is not enough and not everyone has it.

There is always room for improvement; one possible improvement that may not seem very significant but can help the respondent is to ask the questions in a logical order to avoid confusion; another way is to avoid biased questions, that is, the questions should not be formulated in a way that suggests an answer, so as not to affect the results; the result can be easier to understand if tables and graphs are used, which will help to have a more accurate analysis; finally, an improvement can be to pose closed questions, that is, with multiple choice answers to obtain quantitative data.
