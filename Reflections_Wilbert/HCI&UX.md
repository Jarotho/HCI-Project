# HCI&UX

First of all, both concepts must be defined: human computer interaction is a discipline related to the design, evaluation, development and study of the phenomena surrounding computer systems for human use. Similarly, according to Ben Shneiderman (1997), one of the most influential authors in the field of HCI, "HCI is concerned with how humans interact with computers and how to design computer systems that are effective for users". He also argues that HCI should focus on user experience and the design of user interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use, and that allow users to perform their tasks efficiently and successfully. In addition, he argues that HCI must take into account the social, cultural and ethical factors that influence human-computer interaction.

On the other hand, user experience is concerned with broader and more subjective aspects: satisfaction, fun, entertainment, motivation, aesthetics, creativity or emotions. Furthermore, user experience (UX) is a broad field and there are many authors who have contributed to define it, according to Jesse James Garrett (2002), founder of Adaptive Path and one of the main referents in the field of user experience (UX), "User experience is the result of a user's interaction with a product, which includes aspects such as usability, accessibility, visual aesthetics, information architecture, design interaction and performance". 

Understanding the meaning, it can be said that HCI and UX are closely related because both focus on the user experience when interacting with a product or system. As mentioned, HCI focuses on the design and evaluation of human-computer interactions, while UX focuses on the overall user experience, including emotional and subjective aspects. UX is primarily based on HCI principles and practices, but also includes other approaches, such as user-centered design and emotional design.

One specific difference between HCI and UX is that HCI focuses primarily on the design and evaluation of human-computer interaction, while UX focuses on the overall user experience. In other words, HCI focuses on how a user interacts with a product or system, while UX focuses on how the user feels when interacting with that product or system.

An example of a UX feature you could include in the project is personalization. Personalization allows users to tailor the product or system to their individual needs and preferences, which improves their user experience and increases user satisfaction. Personalization can be achieved by including configuration options, the ability to save preferences, and dynamically adapting the system based on user behavior and actions.
