# Personas

The design being used is user-centered design (UCD), a design methodology that focuses on understanding the needs and desires of users to create products or services that are useful, easy to use and meet user expectations.

One of the most recognized authors in user-centered design is Don Norman, Norman has emphasized the importance of user-centered design in creating products and services that are easy to use and meet the needs of users. According to Norman, user-centered design focuses on understanding users' needs and desires, rather than simply creating products that look good or meet certain technical specifications.
 
The specific elements of the toolkit that we want to know in order to create a profile of a person more closely aligned with what we want can be seen under different headings.

- Ideal situation: to know the user's ideal needs and how he/she would like to use the product to be more effective in working with ADHD children.
- Motivations and objectives: to know the user's objectives and motivations in relation to the product. That is, to know why they will use it; it will be helpful to know their motivations to know the capabilities that the program should cover.
- Challenges and problems: to know the challenges and problems that the user may face when using the product.
These elements are relevant to the project because they provide a deeper understanding of user needs and help design products that meet those needs. The method we used to collect these specific elements was a survey through Google forms, sent to potential users to recognize the points mentioned above.

Data aggregation and analysis methods can be used to identify patterns and trends by collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources. Cross-checking techniques, which include comparing and contrasting data from different sources, can be used to better understand users and their needs.

A specific example of how Personas can influence product design is in the creation of a home fitness service. By gathering information from personas, you can identify users' needs and challenges when trying to exercise at home. For example, you may discover that users often have difficulty following a routine or that they would like to have access to information on how exercises are performed; depending on the person's needs will change, as it is not the same for a novice as it is for an experienced person.
