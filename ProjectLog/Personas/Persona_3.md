## Scenario 3

Antonio is a primary school teacher who works at a school attended by children with ADHD. Despite not having much experience, he is always looking for ways to improve his teaching and learn about new methodologies that can help his students. As he enjoys researching education topics, he has realized that technology can be a great aid in the classroom.

To support his monitoring of children with ADHD, Antonio uses specialized software that allows him to track the progress of each one of them. This software has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, allowing Antonio to save time and energy in collecting and analyzing data. Additionally, the software offers him support through various tools to improve and adapt his teaching plan.

One day, Antonio encounters a new challenge: one of his students with ADHD is having difficulty staying focused in class. Despite trying different strategies, Antonio is unsure how to help the child stay engaged in learning. Then, he remembers that the software is specialized in supporting these children.

Antonio decides to use the software, and it provides him with a series of suggestions or activities to work with the child and help him concentrate, based on previous data he recorded. Antonio follows the software's suggestions, and after a few days, he notices a significant improvement in the child's concentration.

Antonio feels grateful for the help he has received from the software. At the same time, he realizes that technology can be a great ally for teachers, especially those who, like him, do not enjoy reading much or do not have as much time to dedicate to data analysis.
