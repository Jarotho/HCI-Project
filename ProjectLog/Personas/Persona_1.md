## Scenario 1

Ana is a teacher in a primary school who works with students who have ADHD. She has noticed that some of her students have difficulty staying focused on tasks and activities in class, which prevents them from reaching their academic potential. To support these students, Ana decides to use support software that allows her to monitor and support the progress of her students with ADHD.


The support software that Ana uses has a variety of tools that can help students with ADHD. During class, Ana uses the software to monitor the progress of her students. This allows Ana to quickly identify students who need additional support and adjust their activities and supports accordingly.


After class, Ana reviews the data collected with the help of the software and can make adjustments to the activities and supports offered to each student. She also uses the software to communicate with the parents and guardians of her students and share information about their children's progress and performance. With effective use of the support software, Ana can help her students with ADHD reach their academic potential and develop in a better way.
