## Scenerio 5

Julian is in his classroom, facing a group of students who have attention and concentration difficulties due to their ADHD diagnosis. Julian has implemented software in his classroom that allows him to monitor students, track their progress, and helps him create and design activities according to their needs.

Julian connects his laptop to a projector and displays the software he uses on the board. He explains to his students that today they will work on an interactive game designed specifically for them. The children are excited and motivated by the idea of using technology to learn.

The game consists of a series of activities that stimulate concentration and memory, which helps students with ADHD develop important learning skills. Julian monitors the children's progress in real-time, using the software to make adjustments and provide personalized feedback.

Julian realizes that one of the students is having difficulty completing a particular activity. He approaches the student and provides him with a visual guide provided by the software to help him follow the game. At the same time, he uses the information from the software to adjust the difficulty level of the game and make it more accessible for that student.

At the end of the session, Julian reviews the software data and realizes that the students have significantly improved their attention and concentration skills. He gives them positive feedback and encourages them to continue using technology to learn.
