## Scenario 2

Teacher Lucia is an educator who, throughout her career, has worked with a wide variety of students, including those with special needs. In particular, she has noticed that students with ADHD often struggle with concentration and organization, which can hinder their learning.

To help these students, Lucia uses software that allows her to monitor their progress and provide feedback. The software is designed to be user-friendly and features a variety of tools that can be tailored to each student's individual needs.

During class, Lucia makes sure the software is up-to-date and functioning properly. She then meets with her students with ADHD to review their daily goals and set realistic targets.

During class, Lucia uses the software to monitor students' progress. She can see in real-time how the students are working and which areas need more attention. If a student seems to be struggling, Lucia can quickly intervene to provide additional guidance and personalized feedback.

After class, Lucia spends time reviewing the software data and preparing reports for parents and other staff members. She can use these reports to discuss students' progress and areas they still need to work on.
