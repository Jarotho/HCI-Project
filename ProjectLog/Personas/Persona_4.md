## Scenario 4

Elizabeth is a 26-year-old primary school teacher with 3 years of teaching experience. She loves music and has extensive knowledge of technology. Recently, she has been working with children who have ADHD and has discovered that the use of support software can be very helpful in helping these students concentrate and stay focused on school tasks.

One day, Elizabeth is working in her classroom and notices that one of her ADHD students, Carlos, is having difficulty concentrating on his task. Elizabeth decides to use the software she has been successfully using to support students with ADHD. She approaches Carlos and, with the help of the software, assigns him an activity to do.

The software's help enabled Elizabeth to create an interactive and easy-to-understand activity, which makes Carlos feel more engaged in his schoolwork. Elizabeth notes that Carlos is more focused on his task and feels motivated to complete it. With the software, Elizabeth can monitor Carlos's progress and ensure that he is doing his work effectively.

After Carlos completes his task, Elizabeth gives him positive feedback and congratulates him on his good work. Carlos feels motivated and grateful for Elizabeth's support and the use of the software that helped him concentrate on his task. Elizabeth is satisfied with her ability to use technology to help her students and plans to continue using the software in the future to support other students with ADHD in her class.
