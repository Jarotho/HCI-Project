The first 2 stages of the process are described:

***1. Research:*** The team conducted research to understand users' needs and desires regarding the experience of working with students with ADHD. Interviews were conducted with users to obtain information about the challenges they face in trying to guide students with ADHD and the techniques they already employ.

***2. Analysis:*** After collecting the research data, the team analyzed the information to identify patterns and trends. As a result, it was discovered that teachers are not very familiar with methods and techniques to capture their attention, as well as that not all schools have a Regular Education Support Services Unit (USAER).
