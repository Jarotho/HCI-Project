## Deliveries Summary  :clipboard:

To carry out the first delivery, we conducted an extensive team research to thoroughly understand our problem and establish the boundaries of our project. This stage allowed us to identify both functional and non-functional requirements, which, for the most part, turned out to be incorrect. The feedback received revealed deficiencies in various areas. We discovered that many of the requirements were not aligned with the actual users of the system, as there was an excessive emphasis on children with ADHD while neglecting the teachers, the true users. This led to inadequate functional requirements and the likelihood that the final product would not meet the needs of the end users. Additionally, we found that the non-functional requirements were not suitable for the developing product, lacking measurability and focus on the needs and abilities of the future users. This meant we couldn't properly assess whether the product met the required quality standards and ensured suitability for the end users. Furthermore, regarding the delivered material, we were informed that the video was excessively long, had incorrect synchronization, and provided insufficient information about our objective, instead of presenting relevant facts.

In the second delivery, the most significant changes focused on addressing the aforementioned issues. Taking into consideration all the details from the first delivery, we corrected the requirements to be more user-focused on our target audience, the teachers, in order to provide them with the most enjoyable, familiar, and comfortable experience possible. During this stage, we carried out the prototyping phase, working closely with educators and obtaining their feedback throughout the design process.

For the final delivery, we decided to add a new non-functional requirement since most of the existing ones could not be evaluated or measured solely with the prototype; they required a fully functional project. Additionally, we reviewed the prototypes once again to ensure their correctness and define our usability testing more precisely, applying them to our users.
