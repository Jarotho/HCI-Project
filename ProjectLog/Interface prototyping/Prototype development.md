# WIREFRAME

Wireframes have been developed according to the requirements and personas that were obtained. We worked diligently to ensure that the wireframes accurately reflected the needs and expectations of the target users.

By working closely with our team, we were able to translate user requirements and needs into a complete set of wireframes. We used user-centered design techniques to ensure that the wireframes are intuitive, easy to use and visually appealing.

We ensure that every detail is carefully considered, from navigation to information organization to visual hierarchy. We also ensure that the wireframes conform to technical specifications and are feasible from a development standpoint.

Every detail has been carefully considered, from the navigation to the organization of information and the visual hierarchy. We have worked hard to ensure that teachers who have a student with ADHD can navigate and use the website easily and effectively.
