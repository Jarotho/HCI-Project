# Interaction Design (IxD)

Interaction design is the process of designing the interaction between humans and digital systems, such as websites, mobile apps, and other software applications. The goal of interaction design is to create a user experience that is intuitive, efficient, and satisfying. We used the interaction design as a tool for understanding the requiremets trazability.

Figma helped us with this task. We emphatized on encompass the non-functional requirements. Based on the color theory guidelines, like using neutral colors and "keep it simple", we create a Typography with legible fonts and "calming" colors (a combination of soft pink and gray). With the major objetive of creating a better user experience, we used buttons that are unterstable and easy to manage, buttons with text. 

Also, with this tool we create a flow for the functional requirements, this with the trazability in mind. 

This is the Typography and the flow of our project.
