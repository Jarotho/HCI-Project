# UI vs UX

UX is defined as the overall experience a user has while using a website or application, encompassing everything from usability and functionality to the emotions and perceptions evoked by the design. In contrast, UI refers specifically to the design elements and visual components that make up the interface, such as buttons, icons, and menus.
However, while UX and UI are distinct concepts, they are closely intertwined and should be considered together when designing a website or application. UX is concerned with creating an optimal user experience, while UI is concerned with the visual and interactive elements that facilitate that experience. Good UI design is necessary to support good UX design, but it is only one part of the overall experience.

The difference between UX and UI is that UX refers to the overall user experience, while UI specifically refers to the visual and interactive elements of the interface. While they are distinct concepts, they are closely related and both are important considerations in creating a successful website or application. 

The easiest concept to see is the UI, in our project we design a interface with a navigation menu as a header. This header has buttons with text and certain colors. You might think that the UI part is easy to do just because it's easy to understand, but it's not. The UI design follows certain patterns and some research behind it, which concludes that the lettered buttons and color choice has to be a certain way to approach usability attributes. The size of the buttons that we choose for the navigation header and the color is based on theory to make the web application easier to use and navigate.

UX is more complicated to explain, because when talking about user experience using logic, one might think that it also encompasses interfaces. An example to clarify this is the Search functionality: This would allow you to easily find specific items you are looking for. When thinking about the user experience we think about the flow of data and navigation. It is different to talk about the designing of components like buttons and to talk about the organization of those components and related information. Our team used theory related to people with little experience with technology to design a web application that is easy to understand, as well as the choice of colors that are soft and "calming". Scanning patterns can be considered in this part, which further clarifies the difference.
