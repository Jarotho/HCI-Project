# :large_blue_diamond: UI VS UX :large_blue_diamond:

Without a doubt, the UX (User Experience) and the UI (User Interface) are two fundamental terms in the design of digital products, since both aspects are critical for user satisfaction and the success of a product.

As these are two fundamental concepts for the design and development of digital products, it is important to know what each one consists of, since it is very common to confuse them and use them interchangeably. In simple terms, it can be said that the UX is the general experience that the user has when interacting with our product or service, while the UI is what we make and put on the screen (controls, buttons, etc.) so that the user gets to live that experience. Briefly and concisely, the user interface is the vehicle for a better user experience.

Regarding our project, we try to generate a good user experience for teachers through a clear and accessible design that includes an appropriate information hierarchy. In addition, as a team, we agreed that in case of implementing the website, it should have a responsive design that automatically adapts to the screen size of any device, thus ensuring an optimal user experience at all times.

Regarding the user interface of our project, we sought to incorporate visual elements that are familiar to our users and allow them to navigate the web page more easily. To this end, inspiration was taken from the "Microsoft Office" interface, using elements such as the toolbar and the shape of the buttons, which are common to most of the applications in this suite. Users' familiarity with these elements is expected to facilitate navigation and use of our website, making it more intuitive for them.

To conclude, it is important to mention that a close collaboration between UX and UI can improve the user experience and brand image, which translates into a competitive advantage for companies. By focusing on the user and the user experience, companies can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, which can lead to significant growth in the long run.
