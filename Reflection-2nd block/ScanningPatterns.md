# ScanningPatterns :eyes:

Nowadays, most of the information is found online and web pages are an essential tool to present it. For this reason, it is crucial that web designers understand how users interact with information online and how web pages are presented. In this regard, the research "Text Scanning Patterns: Eye Tracking Evidence" has identified four main text scanning patterns, namely the F pattern, the spotted pattern, the layer cake pattern, and the compromise pattern. . These patterns are of great importance to web page designers, since they allow them to understand how users read and scan the information on a web page; In this way, designers can create web pages that present information in an effective and attractive way for users, thus increasing the usability and effectiveness of web pages.

One of the navigation patterns that we have applied in our web project is the so-called "layered pattern". This pattern involves organizing the information at different levels of detail, so that the user can access it progressively, based on their needs and objectives.

Being a web page, it is essential to take scanning patterns into account. In particular, for our project I consider that the commitment pattern is the most appropriate. This pattern involves the user scanning and reading the page in a zigzag pattern, indicating that most of the information presented is paid attention to. Since teachers working with children with ADHD have to be attentive to a large amount of information, this pattern could be effective in ensuring that all the important information on the page is paid attention to. In short, by taking the pattern of engagement into account when designing our web page, we can improve the user experience and ensure that crucial information is paid attention to. Additionally, this pattern indicates that users take the time to read and process the information, which is important for teachers who need clear and concise information to help their students with ADHD.

In conclusion, the text scanning patterns identified in the research are essential for web page designers, as they provide them with valuable information about how users interact with information online, in turn, they can use this information to improve the usability and accessibility of its pages, making the user experience more satisfactory. Without a doubt, understanding text scanning patterns is crucial for web designers as it allows them to create more intuitive and efficient pages that meet the needs of the online user.
