# AI Tools

## Midjorney and ChatGPT

In recent years, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact on the field of user interface (UI) design. AI-powered tools and algorithms have significantly improved the quality of UI produced by a person, offering a range of benefits that have transformed the design process and user experience.

One way in which AI has improved the UI produced by a person is by increasing efficiency and speed. AI-powered tools can automate repetitive tasks such as resizing images, generating code for common UI components, and even creating layouts. This allows designers and developers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of the design process, resulting in faster and more efficient production of high-quality UI.

Talking about quality it’s complicated, there are multiples perspectives of what a product with quality is. Software requirements engineering says quality is “the capability of a software product to satisfy stated and implied needs under specified conditions”. We are accepting this as right, reaching quality is covering requirements, stated and IMPLIED requirements.
AI has improved the visual design of UI produced by a person. AI-powered tools can assist designers with color selection, typography, and layout, helping them create more visually appealing and effective designs. This results in a more aesthetically pleasing UI and a higher quality user experience. Midjourney is an AI-powered tool that can create unique images using a description. Midjourney can also suggest changes to a UI that could improve user engagement and satisfaction, such as adjusting the placement of a call-to-action button or simplifying a navigation menu. By providing real-time feedback on design choices, Midjourney can help designers create more effective and user-centered UIs.

Together, Midjourney and ChatGPT can improve an UI design by providing data-driven insights into user behavior and preferences, and by assisting with the creation of effective UI content. By leveraging the power of AI, designers can create more user-centered and engaging UIs, resulting in higher quality user experiences.
Using these tools for creating a web page, for example, is so easy. The time that I use building a project was reduced by more than 90%, since it is only necessary to give a few specific instructions. Learning how to use these tools was also easy, so that’s not a problem. 

Although the final result of building a project with these tools does not consider the usability attributes to a great extent, it is considerably closer to what was expected. It is still necessary for the human part to do an analysis of the data before starting a project: it is necessary to collect data and propose certain usability attributes. Certain metrics would have to be defined to evaluate how close the final product of these two tools really is to the desired attributes. Since data cannot yet be inserted for analysis by the AI, your final product needs to be modified to meet what is expected in terms of usability.

Technology is advancing fast, the day can be glimpsed when all processes can be automated to create Personas, define quality attributes such as usability, make relevant user-centered designs... The role of UI/UX will definitely change when the above is achieved, the analysis and conclusion of the data will not be necessary, which makes this role essential right now.
