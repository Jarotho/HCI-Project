# Personas :teacher:

In any project, it is critical to have a clear understanding of who are the potential users of the product or service being developed. To achieve this, designers and developers must create a persona format that describes in detail the needs, motivations, and limitations of different types of users.

Focusing on elementary school teachers who work with children with ADHD, we use the persona format to gain valuable insight into the specific challenges they face in their daily work. Using this information, we designed an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface that reflects the needs of our users, such as a section for ADHD-specific resources and student progress monitoring and tracking tools. In addition, the user interface was designed to be similar (or so we tried) to the toolbar of Microsoft Office applications (since most teachers know or have used the office suite), which made it easy to navigate and Quick search for tools and resources needed by teachers.

It is necessary to mention that the people format was very useful for us, since we were able to understand the specific needs of our users and thus design a user interface that tries to satisfy those needs; There is no doubt that the personas format is an essential tool to ensure that users are the central focus of product design and development.
