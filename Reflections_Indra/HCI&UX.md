# HCI&UX

User experience (UX) refers to the cognitive perceptions of the user, coming from the interaction with a product, system, service or object, in a certain context. That is, the user experience is about the emotional and sensory aspects that arise during the user's interaction with the product or service. And HCI is based on the idea that technology should be designed to adapt and facilitate interaction with users, it focuses on creating interfaces that are intuitive, accessible and easy to use, so they can perform tasks effectively and efficiently. .

The relationship of user experience and HCI is complex, both focus on the user experience when interacting with a technology. On the one hand, HCI focuses on the direct interaction between users and the user interface, while UX encompasses a broader experience that includes not only the user interface, but also focuses on the individual, their perception of impact, and their individual situation.
Making the difference between HCI and UX more specific; is that HCI focuses on the interactions a user has with the product and how it can be run comfortably, while UX is concerned with providing a complete user experience. User experience design is concerned with developing the experience of a user of applications or services, and human-computer interaction design is concerned with the fundamental understanding of how humans interact with computers, and how can optimize.

One UX feature we could include would be the option to customize the user experience. For example, you could provide color options for the user interface so that children can select their favorite color palette and make the application more attractive and personalized for them. Different activities could also be provided to suit each child's individual needs and abilities. Personalization can help children feel more comfortable and engaged with the app, which can improve their overall experience.
