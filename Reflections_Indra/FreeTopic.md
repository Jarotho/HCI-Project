# Cognitive Models

HCI is the field that focuses on the design and use of information technology and examines the interfaces between people and computers. 
Understanding how humans interact with computers is critical to designing effective and efficient user interfaces. In particles, the use of cognitive models
has proven to be a valuable tool for understanding how humans process information and make decisions in the context of human-computer interaction.

Cognitive models are simplified representations of human thought. These models are used to understand how humans process information and how they make decisions. 
In HCI, cognitive models are used to understand how users interact with user interfaces and how the user experience can be improved.

There are several types of cognitive models used in HCI, including memory models, attention models, and decision-making models. Memory models are used to represent
the way that users store and retrieve information. Attention models are used to represent how users pay attention to information in a user interface. 
Decision models are used to represent the way users make decisions in a user interface.

As an example, the importance of HCI and cognitive models becomes evident in a mobile app design project. Where at first, it is possible to focus more on the
functionality of the application. However, after testing with potential users, the team finds that the app is difficult to use and not as visually appealing.
In this situation, cognitive models can be used to better understand how users interact with the application.

Overall, the importance of cognitive models in HCI is that they provide a way to assess the usability of a user interface.
By simulating the way users interact with a user interface, designers can identify problems and make adjustments before the
product is released to the market.
