# Borrowed Techniques
Based on the Envis Prisicel diagram, one of its areas is usability engineering which focuses on improving the user experience when interacting with interactive systems. One of the methods used in this field is the cognitive walkthrough that focuses on evaluating the design of a user interface for its ease of exploratory learning, based on a cognitive model of learning and use. It focuses on understanding the user's thinking and decision-making process when interacting with a system.

Cognitive methods are originally part of the area of cognitive psychology, they are used to investigate and understand how people process and use information, how they make decisions and how they solve problems. Its purpose is to collect empirical data to help researchers understand the human brain.

The Cognitive Walkthrough method has been adapted to the field of human-computer interaction by including cognitive factors in the various usability evaluation tests. In HCI this method is a precise procedure for simulating a user's cognitive processes as they interact with an interface to perform a specific task in order to assess their experience and possibly identify problems that affect their satisfaction, resulting in a system of software more effective, efficient and satisfactory.

The advantages of the Cognitive Walkthrough is that it's a systematic and rigorous method that focuses on the perspective of the user. It is an easy method to apply, and it can be used to evaluate software products at different stages of development. In addition, it helps designers to improve the quality of the user experience. On the contrary, the disadvantages that must be considered are that this method does not reflect the behavior of the user in the real world, which can lead to results that are not fully representative of the user experience and it can be difficult to identify other usability problems as problems. performance, which can affect system quality.
