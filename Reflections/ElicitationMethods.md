# Interview

To conduct an interview, it is necessary to conduct research in order to structure it and ask questions that provide us with the information we need. It is important to plan it out and ensure that both the interviewer and interviewee are present so that it can be carried out properly. The interviewer should be informed but can also obtain information from the interviewee. Interviews help us gather information in a simple way.

The way we conducted our interview was by first creating a draft and then structuring the questions. We conducted extensive research to obtain the information we needed, and then built the questions which we later placed in a Microsoft form that we sent to several people who were familiar with the topic and could provide us with accurate responses. Although we were able to obtain valuable information, we did not conduct the interview in the correct manner. Interviews involve face-to-face or voice-to-voice conversations, and conducting it as a questionnaire can often tire out the individuals who are completing it and not yield helpful information. A questionnaire is only valid when the information gathered can be obtained through short answers or selections. Although our interview was not conducted correctly, we still believe that it is the best way for our project to obtain good information, and we are continually improving on our methods.
