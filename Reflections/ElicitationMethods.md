# Elicitation Methods

The interviews can be very useful on a project. Knowing how the users work, think and what they want can give a way to the project. Our team considered that the data collected from the interviews will be one of the major guides for our project. We decided to use structured interviews, the team concluded that the information that we want was closed and specific. We also consider that data collected from interviews can result in an artifact on a project in several ways. With that in mind we adapted the questions with the objective of knowing better how our users work. 

The interviews have pros and cons, they can guide your project because they can make users and requirements. In the other hand, the interviews cost a lot of time and the information collected can be the only thing that you have, the information collected can be useless, that is what happened to our team. 

We wanted to make certain artifacts with the information collected, so we don’t really take advantage of the few number of questions that we had. We focus on getting the next things:
1.	Requirements documentation: Our team know that interview data can be used to identify the requirements for a project, such as user needs, functional requirements, and design specifications. 

2.	User personas: These personas can be used to guide design decisions and ensure that the project is meeting the needs of its intended users.

 That cost us a lot of time. In a project first you want to know what is really relevant, what the users really need or want. Knowing, for example, what they think can be useful for their work environment it’s more important than trying to get the functional requirements.
