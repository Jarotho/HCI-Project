After several weeks of progress in the project, we can see further advancement in artificial intelligence and the tools that can be found within it. Today, there are multiple tools available for any type of task we need to perform, whether it be creating texts or summaries. This technology was created to make our work easier, and in the project, we were able to experiment with it by utilizing tools such as ChatGPT and some plugins we found in Figma. We noticed with this implementation that the use of these tools is of great assistance, as we were able to create an interface for our project much more quickly than if we had done so through traditional means. However, there are differences as well. For instance, we found that not all the necessary attributes and aspects of usability could be implemented in the interface created using artificial intelligence tools.

In summary, the use of these tools facilitates many processes, although their quality is not always up to expectations. The progress being made with these tools in terms of UX and UI is slow but steady. Although their usage may not be as widespread now, we can see with the advances being made in many other tools that their use may become better in the future. Artificial intelligence tools were created to stay, and we are witnessing their gradual progress.
