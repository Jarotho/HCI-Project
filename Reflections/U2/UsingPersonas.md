Our personas are of different ages and have different levels of knowledge. This is because the teachers we can find in Mexico are varied and have many different characteristics. Recently, young people have opted for careers related to education, while those who were already teaching are older individuals. There are also people who, even at an older age, continue to teach. Therefore, one essential characteristic we needed to have was an intuitive application that people could use regardless of their knowledge or age.

To achieve this, we implemented elements in our interfaces or prototypes that would improve the user experience. These elements would help users understand certain aspects of the application better and would be easy for them to recognize when using it. We saw this as a crucial step in making the application as intuitive as possible. Ultimately, the use of different types of personas was a crucial aspect of defining many of the elements and features that the prototype needed to have. Working with such a wide range of users required us to consider many different things, including the type of technology to use. Many teachers have different devices, so accessibility was also important, which led us to create wireframes.

In summary, personas are an essential element in creating prototypes that meet our goals. By considering a diverse range of personas, we can adapt certain features and aspects to improve the overall user experience.
