The user interface and user experience are different but highly related concepts. The interface allows us to implement with elements and visuals what the user experience seeks. The interface comprises all the elements, aspects, and objects we implement, such as different buttons, images, text, and others that the user can see and interact with. Meanwhile, the user experience is not usually as tangible. It refers to what we want the user to feel or experience when using something or the same user interface. For example, we want the user to feel that the application is easy to use in our project. That is the user experience, and to achieve that, we need to make it intuitive and implement different elements that allow us to do so. That is the user interface. Another clear example is that we want teachers to feel familiar using the software and feel like they have already used it. We implement this by adding different elements that teachers already know from applications like Word, which they often use. These are just two examples of many that we can find. As we said at the beginning, they can be used together and relate to each other in a way that the interface often complements the experience.
