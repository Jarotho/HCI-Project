# Personas

Creating Personas involves gathering information about the target audience and crafting fictional characters that represent typical users. To create effective Personas, it's important to gather a range of data about the target audience, including demographic information, behavioral patterns, motivations, etc. Every project has different Personas, the team of the project had to do an analysis of this information to conclude what characteristics of their users are really relevant. 

In our project we decided to use experience and education to create our Personas. Experience refers to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that a person has developed over time, and it can impact how users interact with our product. Education, on the other hand, refers to the formal learning and qualifications that a person has acquired.

Because we are doing a project focused on the professors, we decided that our Personas will have a certain level of education in the docent area. We know that our users donâ€™t have easy access to the technology, also that our users never had an approach to technology throughout their lives. So, we concluded that we had to consider the experience with the technology. 

The data collection was through interviews. Once we had the information, the analysis phase was comparing the results with veridical information. We investigated the approach to the technology based on the age range. Also, the information about how our users did not apply their education techniques using any technology (systems that give their ADHD information or systems that can save information of the kids) tell us that the experience with the technology is one of the key aspects. 

Finally, using personas can help ensure that our product meets the needs of the target audience and achieves a better effective product. By having a clear understanding of the target audience, our team can take better decisions using the user-centered design. In conclusion, we can create a product that are more aligned with their needs and more likely to be successful.
