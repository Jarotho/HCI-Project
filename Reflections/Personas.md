For the project we carried out, the main elements we used were experiences and needs. First and foremost, our project aims to create a product that provides different teachers with an easier way to obtain information and support them in their work. To achieve this, we must understand their needs and experiences in order to create a product that satisfies their requirements. Through their experiences, we can learn about how they work and obtain data that can only be acquired through experience. On the other hand, needs are crucial because they are the foundation of the project. To obtain these elements, we not only conducted research but also obtained data through unstructured and structured interviews about experiences and needs. We asked questions such as whether the person had any work experience and how they applied their knowledge. Additionally, we asked about the tools they used or considered most useful or necessary to work with children. Finally, I must mention that through what we obtained, we were able to develop certain tools that helped us. By using people as a basis, we can create a product that is useful for all teachers and meets their needs. We found different experiences and needs among people, which helped us keep everything in mind.
