#Ergonomics

Ergonomics is the scientific study of designing and arranging things people use so that the people and things interact most efficiently and safely. Is about studying the conditions of their work environment for the objective of creating a better harmony between humans and their work environment.  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with technology, HCI study the psychology related to a certain topic, then design a product based on that study with techniques and methods.
 
Ergonomics has been adapted into the HCI field to make technology more user-friendly, comfortable, and safe for users. One way that ergonomics has been adapted into HCI is through the design of hardware such as keyboards, mice, and monitors. These devices are designed to be ergonomic, meaning that they are designed to fit the natural movement and posture of the human body. For example, ergonomic keyboards are designed with a curved shape to fit the natural shape of the hands and wrists, while ergonomic mice are designed to fit the natural curve of the hand.
 
The ergonomics are not only available in the physical area. There is also this way that ergonomics has been adapted into HCI, is through the design of software interfaces. HCI researchers and designers first of all study the cognitive area when designing interfaces. For example, designers may use a larger font size and contrasting colors to make interfaces more accessible for users with visual impairments.
 
Thinking in how the work environment affects our users can be very useful, can even help to create Personas.

Finally, this method has a lot  pros, like giving a value added for the project just for considering more characteristics of the user. But the counter part of this, is that the researchers need more time and money to invest in recognizing these characteristics.
