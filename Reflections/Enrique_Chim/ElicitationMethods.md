# Elicitation Methods ðŸ“‘

In gathering information for system development, it is essential to consider elicitation techniques, which are used to obtain information about the problem domain and system requirements. Elicitation techniques such as surveys, interviews, focus groups and observation allow researchers to collect detailed, accurate and relevant data for their research.

However, while surveys are an effective elicitation technique, it is important to note that they are not the only technique to use. Surveys only provide qualitative information from different points of view, which means that biases may exist and they do not always represent the general opinion. It is important to consider the use of other elicitation techniques to obtain more complete and accurate information.

In our team, we used the survey technique to gather information about the customer's business and system requirements. The questions asked were important to us as analysts and were sent to users via WhatsApp. The responses received were analyzed and functional and non-functional system requirements were extracted. 
I believe that there is much room for improvement in this part, since the surveys only provide qualitative information from different points of view, it is always necessary to perform not only one elicitation method, but several until complete information is obtained.

Finally, although surveys are an effective elicitation technique, it is important to consider the use of other techniques to obtain more complete and accurate information. Interviews, observation and focus groups are effective techniques that can provide additional information and help identify problems and areas for improvement.
