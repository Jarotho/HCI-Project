# HCI&UX ðŸ“±

HCI and UX are two concepts that are closely related in the design of digital systems and products to be used by people. HCI focuses on the interaction between people and computers, while UX focuses on the user experience when interacting with a digital product or service. Both disciplines are important to achieve effective and satisfying design for users.

HCI focuses on the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive systems for human use, with the study of the phenomena involved. HCI theories focus on the capabilities that people have to use computers, the tasks that are performed with them, the communicative structure that is established, and the functional and environmental elements involved in programming and interface design.

On the other hand, UX refers to how users interact with a product, whether it is a website, a cell phone, an application, among others. UX stands for user experience and focuses on how users perceive and experience a digital product or service. 

In the design of digital systems and products, HCI and UX complement each other. HCI is responsible for designing human-machine interfaces, so that users can interact with the system effectively, comfortably and safely. UX, on the other hand, focuses on designing experiences that meet user needs, including aesthetics, usability and the ability to adapt to users' needs.

In my project, UX can be used to develop activities that will be provided to teachers to carry out their interaction with children with ADHD. The idea is to achieve a satisfactory experience for the users, i.e., teachers and children with ADHD. To this end, it must be ensured that the design is user-friendly, with an intuitive layout and the ability to meet the user's needs. In addition, other aspects of UX, such as aesthetics, empathy, storytelling, and brand identity, must be taken into account to achieve a consistent and satisfying user experience.

In summary, HCI and UX are complementary disciplines in the design of digital systems and products. HCI focuses on the human-machine interface and how users interact with it, while UX focuses on the user experience when interacting with a digital product or service. In any design project, it is important to consider both aspects to achieve an effective and satisfying design for users.
