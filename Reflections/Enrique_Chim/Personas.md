To begin with, user-centered design is a crucial approach in the development of any product or service, especially when it comes to technology. People are at the center of design, and it is important to understand their needs, goals and behaviors in order to create effective solutions that meet their needs. In this sense, creating fictitious user profiles can be very useful to better understand users and design more effective solutions.

When it comes to designing software for people with ADHD, it is even more important to take into account the specific needs and difficulties of this user group. People with ADHD can have problems with concentration and organization, which can significantly affect their ability to complete daily tasks and achieve their goals. Therefore, it is critical that software designed to help these individuals focus on addressing these specific challenges.

When designing software for people with concentration difficulties, it is important to include features that allow them to break tasks into manageable chunks and set regular break times to avoid mental fatigue. In addition, tools can be included to help maintain focus on the task at hand, such as blocking online distractions or the option to put the screen in reading mode. All of these can help people with ADHD focus better and complete tasks more effectively.

On the other hand, when it comes to people with organizational issues, it is important to include features that allow them to set reminders and alarms for important tasks, keep to-do lists organized and accessible, and make tasks seem more engaging and exciting. These features can help people with ADHD stay organized and remember important tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

This information is important to know the surroundings, and the environment where our project will take place, and we can also get to know the users and future users very well.

In conclusion, user-centered design and consideration of the specific needs of people with ADHD are essential to create effective solutions that meet their needs. When designing software for people with ADHD, features that address their concentration and organizational difficulties should be included to help them complete tasks more effectively and achieve their goals. By putting people at the center of the design, we can create technology solutions that are accessible, useful and effective for everyone.
