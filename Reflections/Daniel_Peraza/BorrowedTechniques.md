# Borrowed Techniques 

The method that caught my attention was ubiquitous computing, as I had no idea what it was and was quite curious. First, it is important to mention that this concept was introduced in 1988 by the American computer scientist Mark Weiser. Ubiquitous computing is defined as the integration of computing in the human environment, so that computers are not perceived as differentiated objects. So instead of having to actively search for technological devices, ubiquitous computing allows us to have devices integrated into our environment that adapt to our needs and give us a more intuitive and personalized experience. Having mentioned the above, it is very clear that the main objective of ubiquitous computing is to make technology more easily accessible and integrated into our daily lives, in a way that is less intrusive and more useful.

Regarding how ubiquitous computing has adapted to the field of HCI, it could be mentioned that it has done so in various ways, one of the most notable has been through the creation of more intuitive and natural user interfaces. For example, wearable devices such as smartwatches allow direct interaction with the device, while other wearable devices can be controlled using gestures or voice. Another way in which ubiquitous computing has been adapted to the field of HCI is through the creation of computer systems that adapt to the needs of the user; a clear example of this would be a smart home that can automatically adjust the temperature and lighting according to the user's preferences.

Among the advantages of ubiquitous computing could be mentioned that it offers the reduction in the cost of services, better programming and productivity in manufacturing, faster response times in health care, more precise targeted advertising and more convenient personal financial transactions. Additionally, it can help with service delivery in remote locations and improve education in rural areas through the use of interactive media delivery technology. In short, ubiquitous computing makes it possible to monitor and report on many different things through the combination of sensors, network technology, and data analysis. While this method has many benefits, it also has a downside, as it can lead to concerns about privacy and the security of personal information, as well as increased reliance on technology. Also, it can be expensive because smart devices can be more expensive than traditional devices and integrating smart technology into the home can require significant investment.
