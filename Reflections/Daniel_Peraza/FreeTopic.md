## Models and Frameworks

As we know, HCI is a discipline that focuses on the design and evaluation of interactive systems to improve the user experience. In the context of Task-Centered Design (TCD), HCI focuses on designing interfaces that allow the user to complete specific tasks efficiently and effectively. This involves understanding the needs of the user, the characteristics of the task, and the limitations of the system in order to create a clear and easy-to-use interface.

On the other hand, User Centered Design (UCD) seeks to design systems that adapt to the needs, desires and abilities of users. In this approach, HCI plays a fundamental role in understanding the needs of users and creating solutions that adapt to them. The TCD and the UCD are not exclusive approaches, but complementary, since both seek to improve the user experience through the design of intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces.

Interaction Design (ID) focuses on the design of effective and meaningful interactions between the user and the system. This implies the creation of interfaces that allow the user to interact with the system in a natural and efficient way, through gestures, movements or voice commands, among others. ID has a key role in creating innovative and engaging interfaces that enhance the user experience.

User Interface Design (UI) focuses on creating attractive and functional visual interfaces. This includes the design of visual elements such as buttons, icons, and menus, as well as the organization and arrangement of elements on the screen. The goal of the UI is to create clear and easy-to-use interfaces that allow the user to interact with the system intuitively and efficiently.

Finally, User Experience Design (UX) seeks to create satisfactory and meaningful experiences for the user in relation to the use of a product or service. This involves creating interfaces that are not only easy to use, but also emotionally engaging and relevant to the user. The UX focuses on understanding the needs and expectations of the user to create a unique and memorable experience.

Regarding current trends, we can observe an increase in the use of artificial intelligence and augmented reality in interface design. Artificial intelligence allows the creation of more personalized interfaces adapted to the user's needs, while augmented reality allows the creation of more immersive and realistic user experiences. We can also see an increase in design focused on accessibility and inclusion, with interfaces designed for people with visual, hearing or motor disabilities. In short, the HCI continues to evolve to create more intuitive, attractive and satisfactory interfaces for the user.
