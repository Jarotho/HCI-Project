# HCI & UX

First, it is worth remembering that HCI seeks to connect humans with computer systems in a natural and intuitive way, while UX has the purpose of creating and improving products, considering the needs of users throughout the life. interaction process, with the aim of making the experience with the product/service as satisfactory as possible. Having mentioned the above, it can be seen that both are closely related, the user experience is essential in HCI because designers must create systems that are easy to use and meet the needs of users and this can only be achieved through the understanding user needs and goals, prototyping and user testing; then, user feedback plays an important role in this process, as it allows designers to understand how users interact with the system and how they can improve the user experience.

One of the big differences between HCI and UX is the methodological approach of each one. While HCI focuses on empirical and quantitative methods to assess the quality of the interaction between the user and the system, UX uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the overall user experience. More specifically, HCI focuses on the direct and measurable interaction between the user and the system, while UX focuses on the user experience more broadly and subjectively. It is worth mentioning that although they differ in this section, both methodological approaches are important for the effective design of digital products and systems.

A UX feature that could be implemented in my project would definitely be gamification. Gamification involves the use of game elements, such as challenges, rewards, and scores, to motivate and engage the user in learning and training. So, in the case of my project, gamification could be used to make the teaching process easier for teachers and the learning process more fun and engaging for children with ADHD.
