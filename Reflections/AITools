When we use AI tools to produce software, they are often very helpful. They can also be very useful in producing a user interface. However, when it comes to using the interface, it can sometimes be overly simplistic. Even though the quality is not bad, it is important to keep in mind that the way we request the interface, the order of elements, and more, depend entirely on us. We must be very specific and not just ask for an interface that is easy to use or looks nice. We must know about prompts and how to use AI to obtain a quality result that can be used to its maximum potential.

While we can obtain many products through AI, it is also necessary to review the code. Often times, we need to apply software construction and verify its quality, not just the final result, including the names of variables, functions, and more. Ultimately, interfaces created by AI are very useful and usable, but this is where an expert in user experience and other areas can work alongside the AI because the AI cannot extract everything necessary. An expert in this area can work because they have experience and know how the industry functions in many situations, whereas AI does not.

Using these tools is very helpful, but it is also important to know that the help of an expert is still necessary and therefore the best option. However, their use should not be rejected or dismissed. Rather, we must learn to work with these tools to produce quality work. These tools are the future.
