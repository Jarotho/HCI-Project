#HCI & UX

HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and UX (User Experience) are two related fields that are concerned with designing effective and user-friendly computer systems.

HCI is an interdisciplinary field that combines computer science, psychology, and engineering to study the interaction between people and computers. HCI researchers aim to develop user interfaces that are easy to use, efficient, and effective. They are concerned with designing interfaces that support human cognition and behavior, and that take into account the physical, cognitive, and social aspects of the user.

UX, in the other hand, is a subfield of HCI that focuses on the overall experience of a user when interacting with a computer system. UX researchers are concerned with understanding the user's needs, goals, and preferences, and designing interfaces that are intuitive, enjoyable, and engaging. They take into account factors such as usability, aesthetics, and emotional response, and aim to create a positive experience for the user.

The specific difference is that HCI is a broader field that encompasses the study of human-computer interaction, while UX is a more specific field that focuses on designing interfaces that provide a positive user experience. When we talk about HCI we talk about computer science, psychology and engineering, UX is about designing interfaces taking into account the user experience.

A good example for this is that, in our project we considered interfaces with “good” colors, interfaces that can be acceptable for any person. A good general user experience. But applying HCI, we considered the patrons of persons that are not involved with the technology, we consider the psychology of people that is learning how to use an app.
