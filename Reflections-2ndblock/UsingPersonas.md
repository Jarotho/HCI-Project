# Using Personas 
People are central to UI creation. They help bring users and their needs to the forefront of any discussion about functions or features. Personas enable user-centered design by representing users when teams don't have the time or resources to bring real users into testing, but still need to make decisions that impact the user experience. Personas help focus design and optimization efforts squarely on the user and their needs, reducing any subjective decisions about design, functionality, or features. For our team, using people in our project made it easier for us to be able to align our perspective of the product with the critical tasks of the user because we stopped thinking about product functionality and instead focused on the end user and what he needs to do. successful, we found this design tool very useful when prototyping as we weighed each of our design decisions against the yes/no of whether it helps the person achieve their goals.

A specific example of how we use information about our people; You were an older person with limited technology experience, so we made sure to create in our prototype an interface on the main page of the application that was simple and intuitive, with clear buttons, and a content-focused organization to meet the needs and preferences of this person. In addition, we also use information collected from our personas to guide the overall visual design of the UI/prototype; Since one of our people was a creative teacher who valued aesthetics and design, we incorporated more visual elements and pleasing colors to suit her preferences.

Overrall, incorporating insights gained from personas into the UI/Prototyping process allowed us to create a more user-centric design that caters to the specific needs and preferences of our target audience, ultimately resulting in a stage of the process for more successful and effective product development.
