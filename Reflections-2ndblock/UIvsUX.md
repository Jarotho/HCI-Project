# UI vs UX

The difference between UX and UI is often confused or misunderstood, it is important to understand that these concepts are distinct and complement each other in creating a satisfying user experience. User experience (UX) refers to the cognitive perceptions of the user, coming from the interaction with a product, system, service or object, in a certain context. That is, the user experience is about the emotional and sensory aspects that arise during the user's interaction with the product or service. And UI refers to the system and a user interacting with each other through commands or techniques to operate the system, input data, and use the contents. Taken together, UI/UX is the interface through which a person interacts with a system or application in a computing and communication environment, and is divided into a software interface and a hardware interface.

To have a good user experience, both the UX and the UI are essential. A good UI design can attract the user, but without a good UX, the user can get frustrated by not being able to perform the tasks they need to do effectively. On the other hand, a good UX can make users feel satisfied with the overall experience, but without a good UI design, they may not be attracted to interact with the app.

For example, in our project, in the prototype stage; The UI was the design of the main page of the application, including the buttons, menus and color scheme that make the interface intuitive, clean and efficient. On the other hand, an example of the UX implementation in the project can be found in the teachers' experience using the app, which includes the organization of the app elements, as our designs were content-focused to achieve that is presented prominently and aesthetically in the functions in order to provide users with a positive experience.

In conclusion, the difference between UX and UI is crucial to design a successful product; For us, knowing both concepts was of great help when designing the application prototype, since having knowledge of the UX and UI we were able to maintain a balance between the two to create a successful interface that can provide an excellent user experience.
