# Fundamental Techniques for requirement elicitation

Elicitation is a crucial process in the development of a project or an organization, since it allows the identification of the needs of the communities involved and the definition of the necessary requirements to satisfy said needs, always within the established limits. This process requires interaction with interested parties, recording their needs and classifying them into a manageable set of requests that will later, through an analysis process, become concrete requirements. It is essential that good Elicitation is done from the start to ensure that the final project requirements are accurate and meet stakeholder expectations.

Surveys are an essential tool for requirement elicitation as they allow teams to gather data and insights from a large number of stakeholders in a structured and efficient way. Surveys can be used at various stages of the development process, from the initial requirements gathering to evaluating the success of the product after it has been launched.

However, it's important to keep in mind that surveys are just one technique among many, and it's essential to choose the most appropriate technique for each situation. Surveys can be ineffective if the questions are not well-designed or if the sample size is too small or not representative of the target audience. Additionally, respondents may not always provide accurate or complete information in their answers, or the questions may be misinterpreted.

Overall, surveys are a useful technique for requirement elicitation, and when used correctly, they can provide valuable insights into the user's needs and expectations. However, it's important to approach the survey process thoughtfully and carefully, considering the specific context and requirements of the project, and to use surveys in combination with other requirement elicitation techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of the user's needs.
