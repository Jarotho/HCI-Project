# Scanning Patterns
Scannability enables users to quickly navigate through information. Unlike books, websites are not read carefully but rather skimmed for information. With many options available, if users don't find what they need quickly, they'll move on to another source, and that decision scan be made in a very short time. This is where scannability becomes crucial. It allows users to quickly grasp the website's overall purpose and locate the information they require. Despite its apparent simplicity, creating a scannable website involves a great deal of consideration.

In UI/prototype design, it is important to consider the scanning patterns of users because it can impact the usability and effectiveness of the product. A well-designed UI/prototype should make it easy for users to find the information they need quickly and efficiently.

The scanning pattern that is present in the UI/prototype of the project is the commitment pattern, when considering the layout and organization of the interface, users start at the top center of the screen and scan the text vertically down following the center from the screen. This scanning pattern is the most complete for our objectives with the project because the information that the application will offer are medium-long texts about activities or data in general of children with ADHD for teachers. So, it is like traditional reading, where the user would have to read every word on the page. This pattern occurs in this situation because users who are knowledgeable teachers have a particular interest in reading the content. In addition, the web application uses headers and subtitles where appropriate. This allows the user to still can move between different sections and pause when necessary.

Regarding the relevance of considering a specific UI/Prototype scan pattern based on non-functional usability requirements, it is important to note that the goal of UI/Prototype design is to create a product that is intuitive. and easy to use for our target audience, which are teachers looking for support to teach children with ADHD. Therefore, we do consider specific scanning patterns in the UI/prototype design as it is particularly important because non-functional usability requirements emphasize ease of navigation and efficiency. For example, our target audience has patterns in terms of interface design, reading habits, and interest in the same information.
